# Task Management Web App

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced work environment, efficient task management is crucial for maintaining productivity and ensuring collaboration across teams. This React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB-based task management system aims to streamline task assignments, enhance tracking, and offer real-time updates, empowering managers and employees to work together seamlessly. The application is designed to cater to both small teams and large enterprises by offering scalability, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Problem Statement

Managing tasks and projects within teams can become increasingly complex as businesses grow. Employees and managers often struggle to stay on the same page regarding task status, deadlines, and responsibilities. Manual tracking methods, like spreadsheets or paper-based systems, are prone to errors and inefficiencies. Additionally, as teams scale, it becomes challenging to enforce role-based access control and ensure that only the right people can view and edit specific tasks.

The key issues faced are:
- Inefficient task tracking and assignment.
- Lack of real-time updates and collaboration between team members.
- Inability to assign different levels of access based on user roles.
- Difficulty in scaling the system to manage large numbers of users and tasks.

## Solution

The proposed task management web app will provide an intuitive interface for task assignment, tracking, and collaboration. Built with React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, PostgreSQL for relational data storage, and MongoDB for NoSQL data handling, the app will ensure flexibility and high performance. The application will also offer real-time updates to users about task changes, deadlines, and other critical notifications.

Key features include:
- **Task Assignment and Tracking**: Managers can assign tasks to employees and track progress in real time.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different user roles (Admin, Manager, Employee) will have different levels of access to the system, ensuring sensitive data is protected.
- **Real-time Updates**: Task updates, notifications, and comments will be synchronized across the platform in real time.
- **Scalability**: The system will be designed to scale effortlessly, allowing it to handle thousands of users and tasks.

## Core Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users will be able to register, log in, and access the platform based on their assigned role (Admin, Manager, Employee).

2. **Task Assignment**:
   - Managers can create tasks, assign them to employees, set deadlines, and track the progress of each task.
   - Employees will receive notifications for newly assigned tasks and task updates.

3. **Role-based Access Control**:
   - Admins will have the ability to manage users, assign roles, and monitor the overall system.
   - Managers can assign tasks and view only the tasks relevant to their teams.
   - Employees can view and update the status of their assigned tasks.

4. **Real-time Collaboration**:
   - Tasks will be updated in real-time, and all users will be notified of changes (e.g., task completion, comment updates, etc.).
   - The app will use WebSockets or a similar technology for instant communication.

5. **Task Tracking**:
   - A Kanban-style interface for easy drag-and-drop task management.
   - Users can see the status of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed) and filter them based on categories like priority or deadline.

6. **Notifications**:
   - Users will receive notifications for task assignments, deadline reminders, and updates to tasks.
   - Notifications can be sent via email or in-app alerts.

7. **Data Storage**:
   - PostgreSQL will store relational data such as users, tasks, and assignments.
   - MongoDB will handle unstructured data such as task comments and logs.

## Expected Outcome

The implementation of this task management system will lead to:
- **Improved Efficiency**: Managers and employees will be able to track and manage tasks in real-time, reducing time spent on manual tracking and improving overall productivity.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: The real-time updates and easy communication channels will foster better collaboration among teams.
- **Scalability**: The system will support the growth of an organization by handling increasing amounts of tasks and users without performance degradation.
- **Better Task Tracking**: The app will provide clear insights into the status and progress of all tasks, improving the ability to meet deadlines and set priorities.
- **Role-based Security**: Sensitive information will only be accessible to authorized personnel, improving security and data integrity.

By addressing these issues, the task management app will be an invaluable tool for businesses seeking to optimize their workflow management and ensure seamless communication between managers and employees.
